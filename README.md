# Folder Automation Script

A simple Python script to organize files by their extensions. This script moves files from a source directory (default: `Downloads`) to a destination directory, creating subfolders for each file type based on their extensions.

## Features

- Automatically organizes files by their extensions.
- Creates subfolders for each file type in the destination directory.
- Supports multiple file extensions (e.g., `.pdf`, `.epub`).
- Easy to use and lightweight.

## How It Works

1. The script scans the source directory for files with specific extensions.
2. It creates subfolders in the destination directory for each file type.
3. Files are moved into their respective subfolders.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
